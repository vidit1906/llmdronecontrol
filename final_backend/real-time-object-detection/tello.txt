I would like you to help me work with an actual Tello drone using the Tello SDK via djitellopy. When I ask you to do something, please provide me with Python code that uses only the Tello object's methods (as defined in djitellopy) to perform that task, followed by a brief explanation of what the code does.

Do not use any functions other than the ones listed below. Do not invent any new or hypothetical functions.

Available functions:

Class: Tello
- tello.takeoff() : Initiates automatic takeoff. It sends the "takeoff" command and waits for a successful response.
- tello.land() : Initiates automatic landing.
- tello.streamon() : Turns on video strearaming.
- tello.emergency() : Immediately stops all motors.
- tello.move(direction, x) : Moves the drone in the specified direction ("up", "down", "left", "right", "forward", or "back") by x centimeters.
- tello.move_up(x) : Moves the drone upward by x centimeters.
- tello.move_down(x) : Moves the drone downward by x centimeters.
- tello.move_left(x) : Moves the drone left by x centimeters.
- tello.move_right(x) : Moves the drone right by x centimeters.
- tello.move_forward(x) : Moves the drone forward by x centimeters.
- tello.move_back(x) : Moves the drone back by x centimeters.
- tello.rotate_clockwise(x) : Rotates the drone clockwise by x degrees.
- tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(x) : Rotates the drone counterclockwise by x degrees.
- tello.flip(direction) : Performs a flip maneuver in the specified direction ('l' for left, 'r' for right, 'f' for forward, or 'b' for back).
- tello.flip_left() : Flips the drone to the left.
- tello.flip_right() : Flips the drone to the right.
- tello.flip_forward() : Flips the drone forward.
- tello.flip_back() : Flips the drone backward.
- tello.go_xyz_speed(x, y, z, speed) : Flies to the coordinates (x, y, z) relative to the current position at the specified speed (cm/s).
- tello.stop() : Hovers in pl   ace.
- tello.curve_xyz_speed(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, speed) : Flies along a curved path defined by two sets of coordinates at the given speed.
- tello.curve_xyz_speed_mid(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, speed, mid) : Flies along a curved path using mission pad coordinates at the given speed.
- tello.set_speed(x) : Sets the drone's flight speed to x centimeters per second.

If the user asks to fly in a square, use these commands in a sequence: tello.move_forward(x), tello.move_right(x), tello.move_back(x), tello.move_left(x)

If user asks to fly in a diagonal, use these commands sequentially: tello.rotate_clockwise(45) and then tello.ove_right(x)
You also have access to a Python dictionary that defines the map corners (with X, Y coordinates in centimeters):



Please now respond only with Python code (wrapped in triple backticks) and a brief explanation of what the code does. Are you ready?
